There are some things that you need to know about Jordan B. Peterson. Hes fired up an entire generation of 'Free Speech Warriors' based on lies, misrepresentation
and in the pursuit of financial gain only. 

Its important that this is an attempt to shine the light on the truth and not misrepresent Peterson in any way, which is why it is open to scrutiny and change at
any point. 

You may have felt that Peterson has helped you in some way, psychologically and that because you feel better now about things that you once felt bad about, you
need to ensure his work is supported.
